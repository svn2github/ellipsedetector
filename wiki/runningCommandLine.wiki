*minA*, minimum of the major axis

*maxA*, maximum of the major axis

*minB*, minimum of the minor axis

*maxB*, maximum of the major axis

*quality*, the number of points on the detected ellipse

*counter*, threshold until selection of new pair (for the randomized step ... leave it high ~ 5000 is ok, can be higher depending on the speed of your system)

*percentage*, number of feature points to be selected from total detected feature points (good results for 0.05%)

if the tests are run 1 time, than the detected image is also output to the same folder as the source image.
